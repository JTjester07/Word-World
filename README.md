# Word World

Word World is a Puzzle Platformer where you build words to change the world.
The player must come up with creative words that will give them the edge
to move around the level and reach the end goal.

This branch contains all the assets of Word World directly from Unity,
the game engine it was made in. Word World is free to play in the link in the
"about" section of this repository.

Word World was my first game, and it was done in a week for the Computer Game
and Simulation Programming competition for FBLA regionals in Arizona, and it
won 2nd place. This would be the start of my game development journey.
